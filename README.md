# Activerse

Activerse is a Java Game/Simulation/Physics Engine meant to simplify the game making experience for 2D games. Some basic methods are provided for you to create your game. From there, try to create whatever games you wish! The possibilities are always endless. 

Reading this file is pretty useless if you want to get started. Check out the GitHub Activerse Wiki instead, which is kept up-to-date much more for people.

Remember, when starting the engine, always run the main method in Main.java
