## Error handling

As of v1.3.1, Activerse uses the **ACESH System** or "Activerse Concurrent Error Handling System". This is a simple and native error reporting interface that utilizes Java's own stack trace along with error codes; should you encounter broken code (or a developer extending the engine), they will know where the error occurred in greater detail.

This system is always improving. Activerse developers are not responsible for broken or malicious code within their product.
