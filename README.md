# Activerse

Activerse is a Java Game/Simulation/Physics Engine meant to simplify the game making experience for 2D games. Some basic
methods are provided for you to create your game. From there, try to create whatever games you wish! The possibilities
are always endless.

The engine is provided in version releases. Always make sure to install the **latest version**. From there, we give you the tools, and it's up to you to design your next creation.
